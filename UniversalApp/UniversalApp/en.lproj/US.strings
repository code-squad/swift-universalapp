"name" = "Keanu Charles Reeves";
"info" = "Actor. Born in 1964, 54 years old. Official nationality is Canada. His father is a mixed-race American of native Hawaiians and Chinese, and his mother is British. The birthplace is Lebanon. His father then left his family when Keanu Reeves was three years old, and Keanu Reeves settled with his mother in Canada in 1970. Perhaps because of his father's lineage, he has an Asian feeling for a white actor who works in Hollywood.";
